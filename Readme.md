# Exploiting CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013
## Overview
This repository focuses on exploiting two vulnerabilities in Apache HTTPD: CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013. 
These CVEs represent path traversal vulnerabilities that can potentially lead to file mapping and remote code execution 
on Apache HTTPD servers.
For in-depth information about these CVEs, including the underlying flaws, vulnerable configurations, exploits, and 
more, refer to this comprehensive blog post: 
[Dissecting and Exploiting CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013](https://medium.com/@ofriouzan/dissecting-and-exploiting-cve-2021-41773-and-cve-2021-42013-7c116f489ee2).

## Requirements and Execution
To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, you'll need:
- Python 3.7+
- Docker

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/OfriOuzan/CVE-2021-41773_CVE-2021-42013_Exploits
```

2. Build the vulnerable environments and initiate the exploits:
```
cd CVE-2021-41773_CVE-2021-42013_Exploits
python3 exploit.p
```

## Structure
### Directories
This repository comprises four distinct directories, each responsible for constructing a different container for exploitation purposes:

- HTTPD_2_4_49_Map_Files: Establishes a container based on Apache HTTPD 2.4.49 version, vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773 Path Traversal Map Files attack. 
- HTTPD_2_4_50_Map_Files: Sets up a container using Apache HTTPD 2.4.50 version, vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013 Path Traversal Map Files attack. 
- HTTPD_2_4_49_RCE: Constructs a container using Apache HTTPD 2.4.49 version, vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773 Path Traversal RCE attack. 
- HTTPD_2_4_50_RCE: Builds a container based on Apache HTTPD 2.4.50 version, vulnerable to CVE-2021-42013 Path Traversal RCE attack.

Within each directory, you'll find a Dockerfile to facilitate container creation and a httpd.conf contains the specific 
vulnerable configurations. This repository aims to provide a practical environment for understanding and studying these vulnerabilities.
### Exploit file
The exploit.py file performs the exploitation in two stages:
- Builds the Vulnerable Environment: It pulls the required Docker images and constructs the containers based on the information provided in the respective directories. 
- Exploits the Vulnerabilities: It exploits the vulnerable containers with CVE-2021-41773 and CVE-2021-42013.
